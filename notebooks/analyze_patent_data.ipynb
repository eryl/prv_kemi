       " '[0004]    Incidentally, reducing power loss in inverters and converters is an essential issue in many fields such as automobiles, household electrical appliances, and industrial equipment. To address this issue, various semiconductor devices using new materials such as SiC and GaN in order to significantly improve the energy utilization efficiency of equipment have been proposed. These semiconductor devices involve the generation of a large amount of heat during operation. For this reason, semiconductor packages need to be provided with sufficient countermeasures for heat dissipation so as to prevent damage to the semiconductor devices caused by generated heat. Generally, a lead frame or a substrate to which a semiconductor device is joined and fixed is used for heat dissipation. Although the technique disclosed in Patent Document 1 above relates to bonding of a semiconductor device, this technique focuses on the bonding temperature and does not give consideration to heat dissipation.',\n",

       " 'Description of Embodiments',\n",
       " '[0011]    Hereinafter, the present invention will be described based on preferred embodiments thereof with reference to the drawings. A bonding joining structure (hereinafter also referred to simply as \"bonding structure\") of the present invention has a structure in which a heat generating body and a support including a metal are joined to each other via a joint portion. The joint portion is composed of a sintered body made of copper powder. The type of heat generating body is not limited, and any member that generates heat during use can be considered as a heat generating body regardless of whether or not the member is intended for heat generation itself. A typical example of such a member is a die of a semiconductor device (hereinafter also referred to simply as \"die\"); however, the present invention is not limited to this, and, for example, a CPU, an LED device, a resistor, an electric circuit, and the like may also be used as the heat generating body. Moreover, in the present invention, another member that receives heat from a heat generating body, that is, a member that is joined to a heat generating body, for example, and that is heated as a result of that member conducting the heat generated from the heat generating body is also considered as a form of heat generating body. Hereinafter, the present invention will be described taking a die bonding joining structure in which a die is used as the heat generating body as an example.',\n",
       " '[0012]    Dies are obtained by individually separating a plurality of semiconductor devices formed on a wafer, and are also called chips, bare dies, and the like. A die is, for example, constituted by a semiconductor device such as a diode, a bipolar transistor, an insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT), a field-effect transistor (FET), a metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET), or a thyristor. Examples of the constituent material for these semiconductor devices include silicon (Si), silicon carbide (SiC), gallium nitride (GaN), and the like. As will be described later, the bonding structure of the present invention has excellent heat dissipation properties, so that when a semiconductor device that generates a large amount of heat, which is a so-called power device, is used as a joining-target die of the present invention, the effects of the present invention are notably achieved. Examples of such a power device include IGBTs, power MOSFETs, and various types of semiconductor devices composed of SiC and GaN.',\n",
       " '[0013]    The support is used to fix and support the die of the semiconductor device. To this end, for example, a lead frame, a substrate, or the like is used as the support. No matter what form the support takes, the support is made of metal. Since metals are materials having favorable thermal conductivity compared with other materials such as ceramics, use of a support made of a metal has the advantage of allowing heat that has been generated during operation of the semiconductor device to be easily released through the support.',\n",
       " '[0014]    There is no limitation on the type of the metal that composes the support, and the same materials as materials that have conventionally been used in the technical field of semiconductors can be used. For example, simple metals such as copper and aluminum can be used. Also, alloys such as a copper-iron alloy, an iron-nickel alloy, and a stainless steel alloy can be used. Furthermore, a support having a laminated structure in which a plurality of layers of different metal materials are laminated in a thickness direction can also be used. Each layer may be composed of a simple metal or may be composed of an alloy. An example of the support having a laminated structure is a support having a structure in which a base material layer is composed of a simple metal such as nickel, copper, or aluminum or an alloy and an outermost layer is composed of gold alone. The support is in a state in which copper or gold is present in at least the outermost surface of the support. \"Outermost surface\" of the support refers to a surface of the support to which the heat generating body or the die of the semiconductor device is fixed via a joint portion, that is, a surface of the support that opposes the joint portion. Examples of the support with copper or gold being present in at least the outermost surface of the support include a support composed of copper alone, a support composed of a copper-based alloy such as a copper-gold alloy, a support having a laminated structure in which the base material layer is composed of a simple metal such as nickel, copper, or aluminum or an alloy and the outermost layer is composed of gold alone, a support having a laminated structure in which the base material layer is composed of a simple metal such as nickel, copper, or aluminum or an alloy and the outermost layer is composed of an alloy that contains gold.',\n",
       " '[0015]    The die of the semiconductor device and the support are joined to each other via the joint portion. The joint portion is composed of a sintered body of copper powder (hereinafter also referred to simply as \"sintered body\"). The joint portion can be formed over the entire region of an opposing surface of the die that opposes the support or in a portion of that opposing surface. The sintered body of copper powder that composes the joint portion is formed by heating the copper powder containing a plurality of copper particles in a predetermined atmosphere at a temperature around the melting point of copper for a predetermined period of time and bonding the copper particles such that a necking portion is generated between the copper particles. The copper powder, which serves as the raw material for the joint portion, may be a powder of copper alone or may be a powder of a copper-based alloy that contains copper as the base material. Preferably, a powder consisting of copper alone is used. The sintered body of copper powder that composes the joint portion may also contain other materials in addition to copper or a copper alloy, if necessary. Examples of such materials include organic compounds that are used in order to prevent oxidation of the sintered body.',\n",
       " '[0016]    In the bonding structure of the present invention, an interdiffusion portion in which a metallic element contained in the support and a constituent element contained in the sintered body are diffused to each other is formed so as to straddle the bonding interface between the support and the sintered body. That is to say, a portion in which copper or gold contained in the support and copper contained in the sintered body are interdiffused is formed extending from the support side to the sintered body side across the bonding interface. This state will be described with reference to  Fig. 1 . As shown in  Fig. 1 , a bonding structure 1 has a structure in which a die 10 and a support 20 are joined to each other via a joint portion 30 that is composed of a sintered body 32 of copper powder containing a plurality of copper particles 31. Furthermore, the die bonding joining structure 1 has a bonding interface 40 between the support 20 and the sintered body 32. In the bonding structure 1, interdiffusion portions41 in which the metallic element contained in the support 20 and the constituent element contained in the sintered body 32 are diffused to each other is formed so as to straddle the bonding interface 40. When the bonding structure 1 is viewed along a vertical cross-sectional direction X, which is a direction along a cross section that is orthogonal to the bonding interface, that is, when viewed along the up-down direction of the paper plane in  Fig. 1 , the interdiffusion portion 41 extends along the vertical cross-sectional direction X so as to straddle the bonding interface 40. When viewed in that vertical cross section, with respect to a plane direction Y, which is a direction along the bonding interface, that is, with respect to the left-right direction of the paper plane in  Fig. 1 , at the bonding interface, the copper particles 31 constituting the interdiffusion portions 41 each extend over a maximum region R along the plane direction Y, on the support 20.',\n",
       " '[0017]    More specifically, as shown in  Fig. 2 , in the interdiffusion portions 41, a plurality of primary particles 31a constituting copper particles 31 that are joined to the support 20 when viewed along the vertical cross-sectional direction X do not have grain boundaries along a plane corresponding to the bonding interface 40. A \"primary particle\" refers to an object that is recognized as the minimum unit of a particle judging from the external geometric form of that object.',\n",
       " '[0018]    In the interdiffusion portions 41, constituent elements are bonded as a result of metallic bonding. Specifically, in the case where the metallic element that is present in the outermost layer of the support 20 is the same as the constituent element of the sintered body 32, a single phase composed of a simple metal or an alloy is formed in the interdiffusion portions 41. In the case where the metallic element of the support 20 is different from the constituent element of the sintered body 32, an alloy phase containing the metallic element of the support 20 and the constituent element of the sintered body 32 is formed. \"Metallic bonding\" refers to bonding between metal atoms via free electrons.',\n",
       " '[0019]    Due to the fact that the configuration in which the interdiffusion portions 41 are formed in the bonding structure 1 and that the interdiffusion portions 41 contain a phase in which constituent elements are bonded through metallic bonding, free electrons are present in the interdiffusion portions 41, and thus, the interdiffusion portions 41 have favorable thermal conductivity. As a result, when the die 10 of the semiconductor device generates heat due to operating, the generated heat is easily transferred to the support 20, which is a member that is located on the opposite side to the die 10 across the joint portion 30. In other words, heat that has been generated from the die 10 of the semiconductor device is dissipated. Thus, the semiconductor device is unlikely to be thermally damaged. This is important in terms of the operational stability and the reliability of the semiconductor device.',\n",

When the interdiffusion portion 41a that is located on the sintered body 32 side of the bonding interface 40 and the interdiffusion portion 41b that is located on the support 20 side of the bonding interface 40 have the same crystal orientation as described above, the crystal orientation intersects the bonding interface 40, free electrons move smoothly between the interdiffusion portions 41a and 41b, and the interdiffusion portion 41 has even more favorable thermal conductivity. As a result, heat that has been generated from the die 10 of the semiconductor device is even more easily dissipated, and the semiconductor device is even less likely to be thermally damaged. Crystal orientations of copper crystal structures can be determined from a transmission electronic microscope (TEM) image of the interdiffusion portions 41.',\n",

In an example ( Fig. 4 ), which will be described later, crystal orientations of {111} planes of copper are measured; however, the reason for this is that it is easy to observe {111} planes of copper in TEM, and it is not necessary that the {111} planes of copper be in the same direction. Moreover, in the case where a single copper particle 31 has the crystal structures (crystal grains) of a plurality of single crystals, the crystal orientation may be different among those crystal structures.',\n",

The traverse length can be measured from a transmission electronic microscope (TEM) image of the interdiffusion portions 41. The measurement is performed with respect to five positions, and the average value is used as the traverse length.',\n",

Examples of such organic solvents include monoalcohols, polyalcohols, polyalcohols alkyl ethers, polyalcohol aryl ethers, esters, nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds, amides, amines, saturated hydrocarbons, and the like. These organic solvents can be used alone or in combination of two or more. The concentration of copper in the paste is appropriately adjusted to a concentration that is suitable for handling.',\n",
       " '[0038]    The copper powder in paste form is applied to the outermost surface of the support 20.

Simultaneously, the copper particles are sintered with the outermost surface of the support 20, and the copper particles are also sintered with the bottom surface of the die 10. Consequently, the die bonding joining structure 1 is formed, and the die 10 is fixed onto the support 20 via the sintered body 32.

With regard to the sintering atmosphere, an oxidizing atmosphere such as air, an inert atmosphere such as nitrogen or argon, or a reducing atmosphere such as nitrogen-hydrogen can be used. Moreover, sintering may be performed in a vacuum. In particular, it is preferable to perform sintering in an inert atmosphere such as nitrogen in the presence of triethanolamine, because a copper crystal structure having the same crystal orientation can thereby be successfully formed in each interdiffusion portion so as to straddle the bonding interface.',\n",

       " '[0043]    As is the case with the above-described method, it is preferable to use the copper powder in paste form. The copper powder in paste form is applied to the outermost surface of the support 20 using an apparatus such as a dispenser, for example. At this time, as described above, the copper powder in paste form can be applied to the entire region of an opposing surface of the die that opposes the support or a portion of that opposing surface. For example, the copper powder in paste form may be applied in a dotted arrangement like the spots on a dice, or may be applied in a linear arrangement or in a planar arrangement. Then, the die 10 is placed on the copper powder in paste form. In this state, heating is performed at a predetermined temperature, and thus, the copper particles that constitute the copper powder are sintered together to give the sintered body 32. Simultaneously, the copper particles 31 form necking with gold contained in outermost surface of the support 20 and gold contained in the bottom surface of the die 10, and mainly the copper diffuses into gold. Then, gold contained in the outermost surface of the support 20 and gold contained in the bottom surface of the die 10 form metallic bonds that are mainly composed of Cu3Au, which in turn constitute the interdiffusion portions 41 and 44. Furthermore, the solid solution portions 41d and 44d made of copper and gold are formed in the interdiffusion portions 41 and 44. The sintering conditions are the same as those of the above-described case.',\n",
       " '[0044]    In each of the above-described manufacturing methods, in order to successfully form the interdiffusion portions, it is advantageous to use a specific copper powder (hereinafter, also referred as to copper powder P) as the copper powder. Specifically, the interdiffusion portions can be successfully formed by using the copper powder P having an average particle diameter D of primary particles between 0.15 Âµm and 0.6 Âµm inclusive, having the value of the ratio of the average particle diameter D of the primary particles to an average particle diameter DBET that is calculated by assuming a spherical particle shape based on the BET specific surface area, that is, D/DBET between 0.8 and 4.0 inclusive, and having no layer for suppressing the agglomeration of particles provided on the surfaces of the particles. It is preferable to use the copper powder P alone or together with another copper powder. From the standpoint of suppressing shrinkage during sintering and increasing the bonding strength, it is preferable to use the copper powder P together with another copper powder having a larger particle diameter (e.g., having an average particle diameter D of about 1 to 5 Âµm) than the copper powder P. The copper powder may contain a copper powder having a layer for suppressing the agglomeration of particles provided on the surfaces of the particles as long as the significance of the present invention is not impaired. In the case where the copper powder P is used together with another copper powder, the copper powder P can be used in an amount of preferably not less than 50 mass% and more preferably not less than 55 mass% relative to the copper powder as a whole. The copper powder P will be described below.',\n",
       " '[0045]    When the average particle diameter D of the primary particles of the copper powder P is set at not more than 0.6 Âµm, during formation of the sintered body 32 using the copper powder P, the copper powder P is likely to be sintered at a low temperature, and also, a gap is unlikely to be formed between the particles 31, and the specific resistance of the sintered body 32 can be reduced. On the other hand, when the average particle diameter D of the primary particles of the copper powder P is set at not less than 0.15 Âµm, shrinkage of the particles during sintering of the copper powder can be prevented. From these standpoints, the average particle diameter D of the primary particles is preferably 0.15 to 0.6 Âµm and more preferably 0.15 to 0.4 Âµm. The \"average particle diameter D of primary particles of \"copper powder\" refers to a volume average particle diameter that is obtained by observing the copper powder using a scanning electron microscope at a magnification of 10, 000 times or 30, 000 times, measuring the Ferret diameter in the horizontal direction with respect to 200 particles in the visual field, and calculating a sphere-equivalent value from the measured values. From the standpoint of increasing the dispersibility of the copper powder, it is preferable that the copper particles 31 have a spherical particle shape.',\n",
       " '[0046]    It is preferable that the copper powder P does not have a layer (hereinafter also referred to as \"protective layer\") for suppressing the agglomeration of particles on the surfaces of the particles. The configuration in which the copper powder P has an average particle diameter D within the above-described numerical range and does not have a protective layer on the surfaces of the particles significantly contributes to favorable low-temperature sinterability of the copper powder P. The protective layer may be formed by treating the surfaces of the copper particles with a surface treating agent in a downstream process of the manufacturing of the copper powder in order to, for example, increase the dispersibility and the like. Examples of such a surface treating agent include various organic compounds such as fatty acids including stearic acid, lauric acid, and oleic acid, as well as coupling agents containing a semi-metal or a metal such as silicon, titanium, or zirconium. Furthermore, even in the case where no surface treating agent is used in the downstream process of the manufacturing of the copper powder, a protective layer may be formed by adding a dispersant to a reaction mixture containing the copper source during the manufacturing of the copper powder using a wet reduction method. Examples of such a dispersant include phosphates such as sodium pyrophosphate and organic compounds such as gum arabic.',\n",
       " '[0047]    From the standpoint of improving the low-temperature sinterability of the copper powder P of the present invention even more, it is preferable that the content of the elements that form the protective layer in the copper powder is minimized. Specifically, the total content of carbon, phosphorus, silicon, titanium, and zirconium, which are present in a conventional copper powder as the components of the protective layer, is preferably not more than 0.10 mass%, more preferably not more than 0.08 mass%, and even more preferably not more than 0.06 mass% relative to the copper powder.',\n",
       " '[0048]    The smaller the above-described total content, the better. However, if the total content is as low as about 0.06 mass%, the low-temperature sinterability of the copper powder P can be sufficiently improved. Moreover, if the carbon content of the copper powder is excessively high, a gas containing carbon may be generated when the copper powder P is sintered to form the sintered body 32, and due to this gas, the resulting film may crack or the film may separate from the substrate. When the above-described total content in the copper powder is low, problems that may be caused by the generation of carbon-containing gas can be prevented.',\n",
       " '[0049]    It is preferable that the copper powder P has a low impurity content and a high copper purity. Specifically, the copper content of the copper powder is preferably not less than 98 mass%, more preferably not less than 99 mass%, and even more preferably not less than 99.8 mass%.',\n",
       " '[0050]    Even though the copper powder P does not have a layer for suppressing the agglomeration of the particles 31 on the surfaces of the particles 31, the primary particles of the copper powder P are unlikely to agglomerate. The extent of agglomeration of the primary particles can be evaluated using, as a measure, the value of D/DBET, which is the ratio between the average particle diameter DBET that is calculated by assuming a spherical particle shape based on the BET specific surface area and the average particle diameter D of the primary particles. The value of D/DBET of the copper powder is between 0.8 and 4.0 inclusive. The value of D/DBET is a measure that indicates how broad the particle diameter distribution of the copper powder is when compared with an ideal monodispersed state of a copper powder that has a uniform particle diameter and that is free from agglomeration, and can be used to estimate the degree of agglomeration.',\n",
       " '[0051]    Evaluation of the value of D/DBET is essentially based on the premise that the copper powder particles have little surface porosity and are homogenous, and also have a continuous distribution (unimodal distribution). Under this premise, when the value of D/DBET is 1, it can be construed that the copper powder is in the above-described ideal monodispersed state. On the other hand, when the value of D/DBET is greater than 1, it can be estimated that the greater the value of D/DBET, the broader the particle diameter distribution of the copper powder, and accordingly, the less uniform the particle diameter or the higher the degree of agglomeration. It is rare that the value of D/DBET is smaller than 1, and such values are mostly observed with copper powders in a state that does not meet the above-described premise. The \"state that does not meet the above-described premise\" means, for example, a state in which the surfaces of the particles have pores, a state in which the surfaces of the particles are nonuniform, a state in which the particles agglomerate locally, and the like.',\n",

The BET specific surface area is measured according to a single-point method using a FlowSorb II2300 manufactured by Shimadzu Corporation, for example. The amount of powder to be measured is set at 1.0 g. With regard to the preliminary degassing conditions, the degassing is performed at 150 Â°C for 15 minutes. The average particle diameter DBET is calculated from the obtained value of the BET specific surface area (SSA) and the density (8.94 g/cm<3>) of copper at about room temperature using the equation below:  D BET Âµm = 6 / SSA m 2 / g Ã— 8.94 g / cm 3\\n<img class=\"EMIRef\" id=\"688977948-ib0001\" />',\n",

The value of the BET specific surface area of the copper powder P is preferably between 1.7 m<2>/g and 8.5 m<2>/g inclusive and more preferably between 2.5 m<2>/g and 4 m<2>/g inclusive.',\n",

The lower limit value of the crystallite diameter is preferably 20 nm. The low-temperature sinterability of the copper powder can be improved even more by setting the size of the crystallite diameter within this range. The crystallite diameter is obtained by performing X-ray diffraction measurement of the copper powder using a RINT-TTR III manufactured by Rigaku Corporation, for example, and calculating the crystallite diameter (nm) according to a Scherrer method using the obtained {111} peak.',\n",

Whether or not sintering has started is judged by observing the copper powder P taken out of the furnace, under a scanning electron microscope to see if surface association has occurred between particles. \"Surface association\" refers to a state in which particles are connected to each other such that the surface of a particle is continuous with the surface of another particle.',\n",
